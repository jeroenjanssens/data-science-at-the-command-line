Command-line tools for data science
===================================

This repository is a collection of command-line tools that facilitate the obtaining, scrubbing, and exploring of data. Most of these tools are discussed in the blog post: [7 command-line tools for data science](http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/09/19/seven-command-line-tools-for-data-science.html). Some of these are also to be discussed in the upcoming book Data Science at the Command Line, which will be published by O'Reilly in summer 2014.

The `box` directory contains a Vagrant environment for installing these command-line tools. This Vagrant environment has be superseded by the [Data Science Toolbox](http://datasciencetoolbox.org). In case you're still interested, the blog post [Lean, mean data science machine](http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/12/07/lean-mean-data-science-machine.html) contains instructions for installing this virtual environment.
